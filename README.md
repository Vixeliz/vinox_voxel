# Vinox Voxel

WIP BE WARNED


This is a library to help with mc style voxel games in bevy(/rust but right now it heavily assumes bevy is being used but hopefully will become more modular in the future).

Includes support for naive ao(only works properly on full blocks), custom geometry, lighting(WIP), custom voxel types, Palette based chunk for storage space/memory usage, and more?
